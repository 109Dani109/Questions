# Questions


Ask us questions about **anything** related to Open Source! To add your question, create an issue in this repository.

Just a few guidelines to remember before you ask a question:

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered. If it has been answered but does not satisfy you, feel free to comment in the issue and we will re-open it.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- If your question has already been asked and answered adequately, please add a thumbs-up (or the emoji of your choice!) to the issue. This helps us in identifying common problems that people usually face.
- Lastly, be civil and polite. :)
